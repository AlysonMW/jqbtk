This jQuery plugin using Bootstrap v3 to generate a popover keyboard for use on touchscreen devices.

Requires jQuery and Bootstrap v3.

# Installation

1. Add Bootstrap CSS to your <head>
2. Add jqbtk.css to your <head>
3. Add jQuery to the bottom of your <body>
4. Add Bootstrap JS to the bottom of your <body>
5. Add jqbtk.js to the bottom of your <body>

# How to use

Refer to the documentation.html file for examples on usage. Note: since the keyboard listens for touch events, using this in a browser and clicking your mouse probably won't work. However, Chrome's Developer Tools has a 'device mode' that emulates touch events.
